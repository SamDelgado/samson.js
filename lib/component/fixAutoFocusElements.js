// remove the autofocus attribute on the first element that has it and to it the class "samson_focus". remove the autofocus attribute entirely on any other elements that might have it by mistake. This is necessary to have smooth page transitions due to an animation bug in chrome caused by an element having the autofocus attribute. The Samson Router will call .focus() on whatever element has the "samson_focus" class, after the page transition is complete

module.exports = function fixAutoFocusElements() {
  var i; var focusElements = this.element.querySelectorAll("[autofocus='autofocus']");
  for (i=0; i<focusElements.length; i++) {
    var focusElement = focusElements[i];
    if (i == 0) {
      focusElement.classList.add("samson_focus");
    }
    focusElement.removeAttribute("autofocus");
    focusElement.blur();
  }
};
